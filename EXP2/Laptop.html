<p>A laptop computer (also shortened to just laptop;
or called a notebook computer) is a small, portable
personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor,
typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen
mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the
clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside
of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use
the computer. Laptops are folded shut for
transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile
use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to
be placed on a person's lap when being used. Although
originally there was a distinction between laptops and
notebooks (the former being bigger and heavier than
the latter), as of 2014, there is often no longer any
difference.[2] Laptops are commonly used in a variety
of settings, such as at work, in education, for
playing games, Internet surfing, for personal
multimedia, and general home computer use.</p>
