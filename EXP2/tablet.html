<p>A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is
a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating
system and touchscreen display processing circuitry,
and a rechargeable battery in a single thin, flat
package. Tablets, being computers, do what other
personal computers do, but lack some input/output
(I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets
largely resemble modern smartphones, the only
differences being that tablets are relatively larger
than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or
larger, measured diagonally,[1][2][3][4] and may not
support access to a cellular network.</p>
