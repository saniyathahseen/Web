<p>A mobile phone, cell phone, cellphone, or hand
phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or
just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and
receive calls over a radio frequency link while the
user is moving within a telephone service area. The
radio frequency link establishes a connection to the
switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which
provides access to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a
cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile
telephones are called cellular telephones or cell
phones, in North America. In addition to telephony,
2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other
services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet
access, short-range wireless communications (infrared,
Bluetooth), business applications, video games, and
digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those
capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile
phones which offer greatly advanced computing
capabilities are referred to as smartphones.</p>
